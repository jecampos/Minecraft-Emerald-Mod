# Minecraft-Emerald-Mod
A minecraft emerald mod made for the 1.15.2 version of minecraft

# Description
This emerald minecraft mod was a small side project that I was working during the spring of 2021. The emerald mod includes a new craftable set of emerald armor and tools that generally falls in between the range of diamond and netherite in terms of stats. The emerald armor inlucdes a permanent luck status effect and for every additional piece of armor added, the luck effect is increased by 1. When all pieces of armor are put together, there is a permament "Hero of the Village" status effect.
