# Minecraft-Emerald-Mod
A minecraft emerald mod made for the 1.15.2 version of minecraft

# Description
This emerald minecraft mod was a small side project that I was working during the spring of 2021. The emerald mod includes a new craftable set of emerald amror and tools that generally falls in between the range of diamond and netherite in terms of stats. The emerald amrmor inlucdes a permanent luck status effect and for every additional piece of amrmor added, the luck effect is increased by 1. When all pieces of amrmor are put together, there is a permament "Hero of the Village" status effect. If anyone has any suggestions or additions they would like to see email me at jaimecamposbusiness@gmail.com.
